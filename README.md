# Vite Vanilla JS Template

Initially built for personal use, I created this template for starting a new project with Vite.js and Vanilla Javascript. It is already set up with standard development tools like ESLint and Prettier for easy code formatting and linting, with Vite for a robust, modern build process.

## Dependencies

This template uses the following dependencies:

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** A next-generation frontend build tool that offers a fast dev server and optimized builds.
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/):** An open-source JavaScript linting utility that helps maintain a consistent code style.
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/):** An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style across your project.
- **[@eslint/js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@eslint/js) and [eslint-config-prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-prettier):** ESLint's official JS recommended ruleset and a config that disables stylistic rules that might conflict with Prettier.
- **[eslint-plugin-import-x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import-x) and [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-prettier):** ESLint plugins that enforce ES2015+ import/export syntax and integrate Prettier with ESLint.
- **[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/):** A CSS preprocessor that adds variables, nesting, mixins, and more to your stylesheets.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** Provides type-checking support during development via Vite's TypeScript integration.
- **[autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer) and [postcss](https://postcss.org/):** Autoprefixer automatically adds vendor prefixes to CSS, while PostCSS provides a way to transform CSS with JavaScript.
- **[cssnano](https://cssnano.github.io/cssnano/):** A tool that helps to compress and optimize CSS files.
- **[postcss-nesting](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-nesting):** A PostCSS plugin that allows you to use modern CSS Nesting in your stylesheets.
- **[vite-plugin-eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-eslint):** Integrates ESLint into the Vite build process for on-the-fly linting.

## Post-Cloning Steps

After cloning the template, make sure to clean up and update the following:

1. Remove the .git directory and run `git init` to clean the commit history.
2. Clean up the README.md file.
3. Adapt the LICENSE file to your project.

## Scripts

Use the following scripts for your development workflow:

```bash
# Start the development server
yarn dev

# Checks your code for any linting errors
yarn lint

# Tries to automatically fix any linting errors present in your code
yarn lint:fix

# Formats your code in a consistent, predefined style using Prettier
yarn format

# Build for production
yarn build

# Preview the build
yarn preview

# Build and preview the project
yarn buildpreview
```
